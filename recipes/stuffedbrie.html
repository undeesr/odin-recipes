    <h3>Beautiful baked stuffed brie</h3>
    <p>
      One of the most common mistakes people make when serving cheese is not
      letting it come to room temperature first, so that all the flavors can be
      fully realized. This beautiful baked stuffed brie takes that principle to
      the next level.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 small wheel of brie (about 6 to 8 inches), chilled</li>
      <li>¼ cup dried cranberries</li>
      <li>¼ cup chopped walnuts</li>
      <li>
        1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed, plus extra for (optional) design
      </li>
      <li>1 egg, beaten with</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Score the side of a wheel of brie all the way around with a sharp paring
        knife. Cut directly on the "equator" through the rind. Using a long
        piece of string or dental floss, wrap the string around the brie on the
        newly made cut. Loop one end of the string over the other (a half knot).
        Then pulling the ends of the string in opposite directions, cut the brie
        in half.
      </li>
      <li>
        Press the dried cranberries on one cut side of the brie, and the walnuts
        on the other. Quickly put the 2 sides back together with the cranberries
        on top of the walnuts. Press together and stuff back in any cranberries
        or walnuts that fell out.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll out a thawed sheet of puff pastry on a floured surface to about
        1/8-inch thickness. Place brie in center of pastry. Gently pull up edges
        to ensure you have enough dough to entirely wrap the brie. You can trim
        off the corners if there is too much dough. Brush the dough with the egg
        wash. Fold one edge of the dough over the brie and then the opposite
        side. Fold over the remaining edges and complexly encase the brie. You
        can trim off excess pieces of dough, if necessary. Flip the brie over so
        the seam is at the bottom; gently press in the sides to snug the dough
        against the brie. Brush the top and sides of the wrapped brie with egg
        wash.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you choose to decorate the brie with cut-out shapes of additional
        puff pastry, use very cold (almost still frozen) dough to ensure sharp
        lines. Lightly brush the decorative pieces with egg wash. Place the brie
        in the freezer for one hour (this is a crucial step; see note below).
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking
        sheet with parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the brie on the prepared baking sheet. Bake on the center rack in
        preheated oven until it is browned and leaking cheese, about 20 minutes.
        (Only rarely does the brie not leak through, but 20 to 25 minutes is
        about how long it takes to melt the cheese and brown the pastry.)

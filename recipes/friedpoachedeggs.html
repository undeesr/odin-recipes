    <h3>Amazing Crispy Fried Poached Eggs, they are worth your time!</h3>
    This wow-worthy dish is inspired by an appetizer I once had at a restaurant
    and couldn't stop dreaming out. This recipe is a bit more challenging than
    your average egg dish, but tasting the crispy outer crust next to the
    smooth, silky yolk is worth all the effort! You can garnish with whatever
    toppings you want, but pickled red onions will offer a pop of brightness to
    cut through the richness.
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 large fresh eggs</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
      <li>4 cups vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups panko bread crumbs</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped pickled red onions (for garnish)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped green onions (for garnish)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon red pepper flakes for garnish, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Fill a saucepan with cold water and place over medium heat. Stir in
        vinegar and bring to a gentle, slow simmer. Working with one egg at a
        time, crack an egg into a ramekin or measuring cup for easier transfer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir the water vigorously to create a whirlpool effect. As the whirlpool
        is turning, drop the egg into the center of the water. Continue to stir
        gently, cooking until the egg white turns opaque. Using a slotted spoon,
        carefully remove the egg from the water and move to a paper towel-lined
        plate to drain.
      </li>
      <li>In a medium saucepan, heat oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, set up a dredging station with 3 separate bowls. To the first
        bowl, add the flour. Beat 2 eggs with salt and pepper in a second bowl.
        Add breadcrumbs to the third bowl. Carefully dip the cooled egg first
        into the flour, second into the egg mixture, and last into the
        breadcrumbs, coating egg on all sides at each station.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a slotted spoon, carefully drop the egg into the hot oil and fry
        until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes, being careful not to overcook. Drain
        on a paper-towel lined plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Garnish with pickled red onions, green onions, and red pepper flakes.
        Serve immediately.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>6 ½ (1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate, finely chopped</li>
      <li>½ cup butter, cut into 8 pieces</li>
      <li>3 eggs, room temperature</li>
      <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease and flour four
        6-ounce ramekins.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place chocolate and butter in the top of a double boiler over simmering
        water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to
        avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine eggs and sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer
        until pale and thick, about 5 minutes. Mix in melted chocolate, flour,
        and cocoa powder until combined. Pour batter into the prepared ramekins
        and place on a baking tray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until the sides are set but the middle is
        still jiggly, 10 to 13 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>

      Amazing Air Fryer Scrambled Eggs On The Go, they are worth your time!
    </h3>
    This simple air fryer eggs on the go recipe allows you to have a warm
    protein-packed meal to kick-start your day while your coffee is brewing. I
    like to place 2 fully cooked turkey sausage links in the basket alongside
    the ramekin for an added boost of energy.
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>cooking spray</li>
      <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Lightly spray a ramekin dish with non-stick cooking spray. Pour in
        beaten eggs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set air fryer to 370 degrees F (185 degrees C) and place the ramekin
        into the air fryer basket.
      </li>
      <li>
        Air fry for 3 minutes. Stir egg mixture and cook for 3 minutes more.
        Fluff with a fork and season to taste with salt and pepper. Grab and go.
